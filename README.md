Computer Graphics course project – 3D game using OpenGL (Python)

Teach the Baby to Walk – 3D Game (OpenGL)

Overview

Teach the Baby to Walk is a 3D learning-based game that simulates how a baby gradually learns to walk.
The gameplay focuses on progressive learning, balance control, and movement improvement through
trial, failure, and recovery.

The player controls a baby character that starts by crawling, then learns to stand, and finally
walks independently across multiple levels.

All game logic, rendering, and interaction are implemented using OpenGL in Python.

--------------------------------------------------

Game Concept

The game is designed around real-life walking development.

The baby:
- Starts with crawling and slow movement
- Learns standing with balance challenges
- Progressively gains confidence and stability
- Can fall, recover, and improve through repeated attempts

The objective is to reach attractive objects while avoiding harmful ones, encouraging careful
movement and balance control.

--------------------------------------------------

Game Modes

Game Mode
- Consists of 4 progressive levels
- Each level enhances movement ability and balance
- Completing all levels finishes the game

Free Mode
- Unlocks after completing all levels
- Allows free exploration with no time limit or restrictions

--------------------------------------------------

Gameplay Mechanics
- Movement control (forward, backward, rotation)
- Balance control using a stability meter
- Fall and recovery system instead of instant failure
- Collectible items that increase score and balance 
- Harmful objects and colliding with furnitures and walls that decrease score and balance
- Collectible item which activates special ability

--------------------------------------------------

Technology Used
- Python
- OpenGL (PyOpenGL)
- GLUT for rendering loop and input handling

--------------------------------------------------

What I Learned
While developing this project, I gained practical experience in:

- OpenGL rendering pipeline and 3D transformations
- Event-driven graphics programming
- Camera systems (third-person and first-person perspectives)
- Scene rendering and object composition
- Game state management and level progression
- Translating computer graphics theory into an interactive application
